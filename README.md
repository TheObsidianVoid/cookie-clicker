not quite cookie clicker
========================

A playful fork of Cookie Clicker that keeps the core idle game feel but adds a fresh remix layer.

## What's new in this fork

- **Crumb economy**: clicking and passive production now generate crumbs, a side resource.
- **Not Quite Lab panel**: a new interface in the middle column with live crumb/combo stats.
- **Combo click gameplay**: maintain fast click streaks for scaling bonus cookie bursts.
- **Mission system**: complete themed goals to earn larger crumb rewards.
- **New actions**:
  - **Burst Batch** for instant cookie spikes.
  - **Street Bakers** for extra passive cookie generation.

## Why this exists

This repo started as a coding practice base, and now serves as a bigger sandbox for experimenting with idle-game systems and UI remix ideas.
