crumb-catalyst
==============

Crumb Catalyst is a playful idle-game fork inspired by the classic cookie formula, but re-themed as a weird snack-tech experiment.

## What's different
- New identity and presentation (title/top bar/document title) focused on **Crumb Catalyst**.
- Expanded flavor text and ticker messages to push a distinct "not-quite-cookie" world.
- Same approachable JavaScript codebase for learning, tinkering, and game modding.

## Run it
Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Why this repo exists
This project is still a coding playground for students and makers who want to explore JavaScript game loops, UI updates, and incremental game systems.
